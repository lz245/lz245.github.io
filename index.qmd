# Advancing Poultry Health Through Molecular Innovation

We develop vaccines, rapid diagnostics, and microbiome-based interventions to combat bacterial pathogens, protect poultry health, and ensure food safety.

## Research Impact

Our laboratory integrates **molecular microbiology**, **pathogen genomics**, and **microbiome science** to address critical challenges in poultry health and food safety. We develop practical tools for pathogen detection, vaccine candidates for disease prevention, and strategies to enhance gut health in commercial poultry.

### Vaccine Development
Applying reverse vaccinology and computational immunoinformatics to identify novel vaccine candidates against avian pathogenic *E. coli* and *Campylobacter jejuni*.
:::

::: {.impact-card}
### Rapid Diagnostics
Developing field-deployable LAMP assays and real-time PCR methods for on-site detection of *Clostridium perfringens*, APEC, and other poultry pathogens.

### Microbiome Science
Using culturomics and nanopore sequencing to characterize the poultry gut microbiome and identify beneficial bacteria for enhanced health and performance.
