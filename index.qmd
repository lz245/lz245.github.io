# Advancing Food Safety and Security Through Molecular Innovation

We develop advanced molecular detection methods, study pathogen biofilms, and apply whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics to address critical challenges in agricultural microbiomes, animal health and food safety.

## Research Focus

Our laboratory integrates **agricultural microbiomes**, **microbial genomics**, and **bioinformatics** to develop practical solutions for pathogen detection, characterization, and control. I work at the intersection of fundamental microbiology and applied food safety, developing tools and knowledge that directly benefit industry, regulatory agencies, and public health.
