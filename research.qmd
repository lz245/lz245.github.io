## Research Programs

### Poultry Gut Microbiome & Culturomics

We identify and isolate core beneficial gut microbes using high-throughput culturing and metagenomics, with applications in probiotic development and gut health optimization.

**Why it matters**
- Reduces production losses by improving gut health and resilience.
- Supports antimicrobial stewardship through prevention-focused solutions.
- Enables earlier detection and targeted intervention using genomics and analytics.

**Deliverables**
- Curated isolate libraries + functional annotations
- Validated biomarkers / signatures for health and disease
- Field-ready decision support (sampling → sequencing → interpretation pipeline)

### Avian Pathogenic *E. coli* and Host Interactions

We investigate virulence mechanisms, host immune responses, and tissue-level pathology to understand bacterial pathogenesis and vaccine targets.

### Disease Surveillance & Data-Driven Diagnostics

We develop rapid detection and monitoring tools integrating genomics, machine learning, and sensor-based systems for poultry health.

This work directly benefits **producers, veterinarians, integrators, and public health stakeholders** by enabling actionable microbial insights that improve animal welfare and reduce the risk of foodborne contamination.
