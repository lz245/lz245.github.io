### Poultry Gut Microbiome & Culturomics

We identify and isolate core beneficial gut microbes using high-throughput culturing and metagenomics, with applications in probiotic development and gut health optimization.

### Avian Pathogenic *E. coli* and Host Interactions

We investigate virulence mechanisms, host immune responses, and tissue-level pathology to understand bacterial pathogenesis and vaccine targets.

### Disease Surveillance & Data-Driven Diagnostics

We develop rapid detection and monitoring tools integrating genomics, machine learning, and sensor-based systems for poultry health.
