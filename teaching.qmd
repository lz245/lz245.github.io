## Teaching Philosophy

I am committed to training the next generation of scientists in **agricultural microbiomes** and **food safety**. My teaching emphasizes **hands-on laboratory skills**, **advanced molecular methods**, and **real-world applications** of microbiology. I combine fundamental concepts with cutting-edge techniques including bioinformatics, whole-genome sequencing, and molecular diagnostics.

1. **Individual Development Plans (IDPs)** — All graduate students create and regularly update career development plans
2. **Weekly one-on-one meetings** — Regular meetings to discuss research progress and challenges
3. **Professional development** — Support for conference attendance, scientific writing, and career exploration
4. **Hands-on training** — As a molecular biologist, I personally train students in laboratory techniques
5. **Collaborative environment** — Lab members support each other and contribute to departmental activities
6. **Work-life balance** — Expectations that respect personal well-being

### Laboratory Training

I provide hands-on training to graduate students throughout the department in molecular biology techniques including:
