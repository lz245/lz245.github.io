ALTERNATIVE TEAM PAGE (No R Required)
=====================================
This is a simpler version of team.qmd that uses pure Quarto/Markdown.
To use this version instead:
1. Delete or rename team.qmd
2. Rename this file to team.qmd

The tradeoff is that you manually edit this file instead of 
updating the YAML data file. For small labs (<10 people), 
this approach may be easier to maintain.
