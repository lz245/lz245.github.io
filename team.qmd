### Li Zhang, Ph.D.

**Assistant Professor**  
Department of Poultry Science  
Mississippi State University

Dr. Li Zhang is an Assistant Professor specializing in molecular microbiology, pathogen genomics, and food safety. His research focuses on developing vaccines against avian pathogenic *E. coli* and *Campylobacter jejuni*, rapid molecular diagnostic tools (LAMP, qPCR), and understanding the poultry gut microbiome through culturomics and nanopore sequencing. He has secured over $4 million in research funding as PI and published 67+ peer-reviewed articles.
